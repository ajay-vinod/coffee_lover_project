            <p>A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of
                intake
                and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee
                daily.
                Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible increased risk
                in
                pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated by poor study quality,
                and
                differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size.</p>

        <h2 class="types">TYPES</h2>
        <p class="ptypes">
            Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a
            genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs to
            trees.
        </p>
        <ul class="ultypes">
            <li><strong>Type of bean.</strong> There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica
                originates from
                Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide. However,
                it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade,
                humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more
                economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures
                between 65-97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in
                rainfall and strong sunlight.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Type of roast.</strong> Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce
                a chemical
                change that releases the rich aroma and flavor that we associate with coffee. They are then cooled and
                ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the roast, the
                lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity. Dark roasts produce a black bean with
                little acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular French roast is medium-dark.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Type of grind.</strong> A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee
                makers. A fine grind
                is used for deeper flavors like espresso, which releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used in coffee
                presses.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Decaffeinated coffee.</strong> This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side
                effects from caffeine.
                The two most common methods used to remove caffeine from coffee is to apply chemical solvents (methylene
                chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon dioxide gas. Both are applied to steamed or soaked beans, which are
                then allowed to dry. The solvents bind to caffeine and both evaporate when the beans are rinsed and/or
                dried. According to U.S. regulations, at least 97% of the caffeine must be removed to carry the
                decaffeinated label, so there may be trace residual amounts of caffeine. Both methods may cause some
                loss of flavor as other naturally occurring chemicals in coffee beans that impart their unique flavor
                and scent may be destroyed during processing.</li>

            <h2 class="types">TOP BRANDS</h2>
            <div class="brand">
                <img class="brand-img1" src="./images/starbucks.jpg" alt="">
                <h3>1. Starbucks</h3>
                <p>The brand is not known for sourcing and roasting the best coffee beans. Most of their coffee beans
                    are dark roasted, meaning, they taste bitter. And many consumers, who know their coffee, complain
                    that Starbucks coffee has a distinct burnt taste.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="brand">
                <img class="brand-img2" src="./images/dunkin_doughnuts.gif" alt="">
                <h3>2. Dunkin' Doughnuts</h3>
                <p>Dunkin' is not as big a brand as Starbucks but they are second in line in the number of stores. But
                    yes, the coffee Dunkin' offers is surely somewhat superior to Starbucks. For instance, Dunkin' does
                    not have the signature burnt taste in coffee as Starbucks does. The coffee is also cheaper.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="brand">
                <img class="brand-img1" src="./images/costa.jpg" alt="">
                <h3>3. Costa Coffee</h3>
                <p>Costa coffee is one of the largest coffee chains in Britain. Having its presence in more than 31
                    countries worldwide, it has more than 3000 outlets serving coffee with around 18 thousand branches
                    in the whole world.</p>

            <div class="brand">
                <img class="brand-img2" src="./images/mccafe.gif" alt="">
                <h3>4. McCafé</h3>
                <p>Owned by McDonald's, McCafe is one of the leading coffee chains in countries like Australia and New
                    Zealand. McCafé enjoys the benefit of having a vast presence (Because let's face it, McDonald's is
                    everywhere!) As McDonald's expands worldwide, there is a decent chance of McCafé doing the same.</p>

                <img class="brand-img1" src="./images/peets_coffee.jpg" alt="">
                <h3>5. Peet's Coffee</h3>
                <p>Peet's coffee is said to be fairly stronger than the coffee Starbucks serves so it might not be for
                    everyone. Peet's has a long history of serving darker roasted Arabica coffee. The coffee supposedly
                    has a variety of flavours .</p>
